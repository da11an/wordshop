you or me
Caleb is a one year old
I had a bad day
by Leah
this is my word
but Mama said no
not the dog or the cat
what child is this
all cats and dogs
they were not home
we play
when you said eat
your cat has a bum of the year
can you go with me
he said she said
there was a dog in my home
use it with the cat
we have an oil can
each dog had one cat
which dog is your cat
she did not have a cat
do you have a cat
how did you get a cat
their cat is a dog
if your cat is a dog is it a cat
will you cat be a dog
up here there is a cat
other than that
there are about 5 dogs
out here we can see the dogs
many cats are not dogs
then see if you can
do not see them
these are the cats or dogs
so what did you see
some may not be cats
her cat is a pig
would you eat a pig
would you make a pig eat
I like the pig
that pig is not him
get into here
time for a pig day
he has a pig or a cat
look at the water
two cats like a pig
I have more cats than dogs
write about the cat
go to the people
see if you would like more
number two or number one
no I will not call you
way to go
could it be so
people are not dogs
my pig is a dog or cat
more pigs than cats are here
first see what he said
water is so wet
I have been to see the pig
call me the pig
who would you like to see now
oil is for pigs
its water is so red
now go tell the cat
find me that pig
how long did you go
call it down from the people
that day was a sad time
did you see it
get down here
come find the people
I made you
may you find a cat or pig
part of me did not see
